A Promise in JavaScript is a way to handle asynchronous operations—like fetching data from an API, reading a file, or querying a database—without blocking the rest of the code.

Think of it like this:

“A Promise is a placeholder for a value that will exist in the future.”


🔄 Promise States
A Promise has 3 states:

State	Meaning
pending	The operation is still in progress
fulfilled	The operation completed successfully
rejected	The operation failed
