Perfect — here's a clear flow (architecture) for a restaurant ordering system using Node.js (no code, just structure):

🔁 Flow Overview
1. User Browses Restaurants
User hits an endpoint to get a list of available restaurants.

Each restaurant has a menu (list of food items).

2. User Views Food Items
User selects a restaurant.

Fetch all food items under that restaurant.

3. User Places Order
User selects food items with quantities.

Sends a request to create an order:

User ID

Restaurant ID

List of food items + quantity

Optional notes (e.g., "extra spicy")

4. Backend Validates & Saves Order
Check if:

Restaurant exists

Food items belong to that restaurant

Save order to DB with status: pending

5. Restaurant Receives Order
Orders for a restaurant can be fetched by the restaurant owner.

Order status can be updated: accepted, preparing, delivered, cancelled

6. User Tracks Order
User can fetch their order by ID or list all past orders.

See current status (e.g., preparing/delivered).

🗂 Suggested Entities (Collections / Tables)
users: info about users.

restaurants: info about each restaurant.

foods: food items tied to a restaurant.

orders: who ordered what, where, and what status.

🔐 Authentication
Protect user actions with JWT/session (e.g., placing orders).

Protect restaurant owner actions separately (e.g., updating status).

If you'd like, I can help expand on any of the above steps (e.g., payment, rating, delivery assignment).
